# Boxes

Boxes has acquired explicit permission from trademark owners for the usage and
shipment (though we don't ship them but rather download them on demand) of their
logos[1][3]. Please note that this permission does not extend to any derivate
work but only applies to Boxes for the very specific purpose of identifying the
products in question.

Following are the owners for each logo:

Fedora: Red Hat, Inc.
Ubuntu: Canonical Ltd.
openSUSE: Novell, Inc. [2]
Debian: SPI (Software in the Public Interest).
Red Hat Enterprise Linux: Red Hat, Inc.
Manjaro: Manjaro GmbH & Co. KG

The Fedora board/legal required we keep a special note in this file:
```
   Fedora®, the Fedora word design, and the Infinity design logo, either
   separately or in combination, are hereinafter referred to as "Fedora
   Trademarks" and are trademarks of Red Hat, Inc., registered in the
   United States and other countries. The Boxes software contains images
   that are or include the Fedora Trademarks. You are granted a a
   license to copy and redistribute unmodified image files containing
   the Fedora Trademarks only for the purpose of indicating Fedora VM
   instances in the Graphical Interface for the Boxes software, as
   described to the Fedora Board on 2012-02-21. No other permission is
   granted.

   All such rights are granted to you provided that the above trademark
   legend and this license are included with each copy you make, and
   they remain intact and are not altered, deleted, or modified in any
   way.
```

[1] with the exception of Debian logo due to its very liberal licensing:

http://www.debian.org/logos/

and GNOME logo due to the fact that Boxes is part of it and use of a project's
logo by project itself should not raise any legal concerns. For use of GNOME
logo in other projects, please refer to:

http://www.gnome.org/logo-and-trademarks/

    permissions to use their logos in Boxes:

openSUSE would like to have our logo show up as one of the installable
OSes within Boxes. Please ensure that you follow the Trademark
Guidlines[0]. If you would like to modify the logo to work better with
the application, please submit your proposal of a modified logo for
approval. This is *ONLY* for openSUSE and _NOT_ for SUSE Enterprise
Linux.

Many thanks and regards,

Andy

Hello,

Thanks a lot for the logo.
I just did one thing to verify the green is the one from the artwork
guidelines (which it is! :)) and I have to say a big thank you for
tweaking it to be visible.

Cheers

Subject: [redhat.com #10108047] Use of "Shadow Man" logo in GNOME Boxes
From: "Pam Chestek via RT" <tmlicense@redhat.com>
To: zeenix@redhat.com

Zeeshan,

The use of the Shadowman logo without the Red Hat word mark included is
approved for use in the manner shown in the screenshot you provided,
i.e., as a graphical representation of an operating system choice
available when using the "Boxes" software. This permission is granted
for the Boxes project and also any Red Hat incorporation of the Boxes
software into its commercial product.

The use is approved conditioned on (1) also including the product name
of the operating system, e.g., "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6" and (2) that
an image file is not provided as part of the Boxes software but rather
the logo is downloaded at runtime is is available only for a user that
already has a Red Hat operating system available to him or her.

Paula Weigel can help you with a copy of the logo.

Subject: Your application to Ubuntu to Trademarks

Hi Zeeshan,

Thank you for contacting us and for your interest in and support of Ubuntu.

============

We have been working on a new GNOME
application, Boxes[1] that (among other things) enables users to easily
manage virtuat-machines. This also includes ability to detect
operating-systems given an installation media and presenting an
intuitive and impressive UI to user to easily install different
operating systems with minimum or no interaction. Boxes makes use of a
new library, libosinfo[2] that provides information about operating
systems (which it internally keeps in an XML database).

Can we get explicit permission to use the Ubuntu logo (as shown in the screen[3]) and distribut it as part of libosinfo or Boxes itself?

Canonical is the official sponsor of the Ubuntu project and owns the trademarks, both in the word and logo form, relating to the project.

To keep the balance between the integrity of our trademarks and the ability to customise Ubuntu, we’ve tried to define a reasonable trademark policy that allows our Community to use Ubuntu and to promote the project. You can read the full policy at http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy.

As your intent is to promote the Ubuntu brand and show your support of the software, we have no issue with you producing the product as you have requested.

You can find our brand guidelines and downloadable images at http://design.ubuntu.com/.

Thanks again for your support.

Hey Felipe, 

This sounds amazing! Yes, we are definitely interested and happy to have you place our logo there. I spoke with some others within Endless and it looks like we may need to find you the right logo assets. We are still in the process of creating logo guidelines and such, so in the meantime, I'll just ask our designers for guidance here. It looks like the logos in GNOME Boxes are circular. Are there dimensions or anything you can give me so I can ask our designers to create an appropriate asset? 

Rob McQueen also mentioned that it'd be great if you could get the images you need from our live feed: https://github.com/endlessm/eos-meta/blob/master/eos-tech-support/eos-download-image

Please let me know if there's anything else you need for this. Thank you again so much for including us, we really appreciate it!

Best, 
Nuritzi

Hey Felipe!

Attached is the Pop!_OS logo svg file for inclusion in GNOME Boxes.  We're all very excited that you're including support in GNOME Boxes.  We might put something out in social about it.  Worth celebrating!  Hope that is okay.
